# A Rust Game Engine

In an effort to learn the Rust language (because I am a nut), I am building a game engine. The "tutorial" I am following is Andre LaMothe's *Tricks of the Windows Game Programming Gurus* and *Tricks of the 3D Game Programming Gurus*. I am going to do a commit/push with tag after every thing I create based on the book.

## Statement about tagging

Version tagging is based on the "Program Number" from the book itself and the book. So Major version will be the book (1 = *Tricks of the Windws Game Programming Gurus*, 2 = *Tricks of the 3D Game Programming Gurus*) and the minor is a reference to that program number (the books came with CDs containg the code, I have long since lost those CDs, not that it matters, but I am skipping black box development discussions as I have to recreate everything anyway as it was all originally written in C/C++).
